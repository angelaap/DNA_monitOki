# Temporal physicochemical and biological data on Okinawa coastal ecosystems

This repository includes all the codes and intermediate documents and figures generated from the code analysing the seasonal physical, chemical and biological (16s) observed in Okinawa nearshore seawater from September of 2020 to September 2021. Samples were collected each two weeks.

Below a detailed description for each of the analysis

## Nutrient data analysis

Here an overview of the exploratory analysis of the nutrient concentrations

## Biological data analysis

The amplicon sequence analysis will is performed with Qiime 2 tool. The first part of the analysis is carried out in Terminal, where the most of computational demaning jobs are carried out on *Deigo and the second part will be performed with R. 

The sequences are received from the OIST sequencing center are 

### Qiime2 Setup

QIIME 2 is usually installed by following the [official installation instructions](https://docs.qiime2.org/2021.8/install/).

In terminal, once
